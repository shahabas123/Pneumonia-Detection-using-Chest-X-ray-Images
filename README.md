Project Overview

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory condition that requires early detection for effective treatment. 
This app uses a deep learning model trained on chest X-ray images to predict whether a patient has pneumonia. 
The app is designed to assist healthcare professionals in making quick and accurate diagnoses.

Features

Upload X-ray Images: Users can upload chest X-ray images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.

Real-time Prediction: The app predicts whether the uploaded image shows signs of pneumonia.

Confidence Score: Displays the confidence level of the prediction.

User-friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit for a simple and intuitive interface.

Usage

Home Page: Provides an overview of the app and its features.

About Page: Contains information about pneumonia, the dataset, and the technology used.

Prediction Page:

Upload a chest X-ray image.

View the prediction result and confidence score.

Contact Page:

Provides contact information for the developer.

Dataset

The model was trained on the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains over 5,000 X-ray images categorized into two classes:

Normal: No signs of pneumonia.

Pneumonia: Signs of pneumonia present.

Model

Architecture: The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras.

Input Size: Images are resized to 150x150 pixels.

Performance:

Accuracy: 80%


Technologies Used

Streamlit: For building the web app.

TensorFlow/Keras: For training the deep learning model.

Python: For backend development.

Pillow: For image processing.

NumPy: For numerical computations.
